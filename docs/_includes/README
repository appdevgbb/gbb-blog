# Jekyll _includes folder

To avoid mixing LibDoc files and user files, this folder contains only a subfolder named `libdoc` which contains necessary files of LibDoc's Theme. **Place your includes files anywhere into this folder excepting into libdoc folder**, this avoids overwriting or delete your work on future LibDoc updates.
